# Arsenal

Arsenal is an app that provides the most up-to-date roster of Arsenal players. From that roster, one can select one of the players for their profile.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'arsenal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install arsenal

## Usage

At first, you will be welcomed by the app. You will be shown a roster of all the current Arsenal players. This list is an up-to-date list as per the Arsenal.com official website. You will then need to choose one of those players in order to get their full profile. You should enter the number on the list next to player's name in order to get more information about the player. Once you have entered a valid number, you will be shown that player's profile info. Please note to exit you need to either type 0 or an invalid number (not shown on the list).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
